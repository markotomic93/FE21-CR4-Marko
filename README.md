# FE32-CR4-Marko
 
For this CodeReview, the following criteria were graded: 120 points reached.

(5 points) Create a GitHub Repository named: FE21-CR4-YourName. Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (lms). Please add codefactorygit as a collaborator! See an example of a GitHub link below:

https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git

(5 points) Correct HTML, CSS and JavaScript code structure and code indentation.

(20 points) Use bootstrap to help you create the provided design. You can complement your design with CSS/SASS/SCSS, but at least the container holding the film information should use bootstrap classes for responsiveness. The container should have 3 columns in a row for larger screens, 2 columns in a row on medium screens (provided layout) and 1 column in a row on small/extra small screens.

(15 points) Correct creation of JSON file to hold movies’ data. Please note that for this task you can provide the information/data of any movie you want. E.g:

{

"movieName": "A Star is Born",

"image": "img/star.jpg",

"description": "Short description",

"likes": 0,
}

(20 points) Correct creation of the HTML/Bootstrap structure dynamically using JavaScript (please do not hard code, elements should be created by JavaScript not written in the HTML file). The following should be shown on the screen: the movie name, a short description, movie poster according to the provided design. Feel free to expand the information as: genre, release date, etc...

(15 points) As it is in the example template, there should be a button to every movie that calls a function which will increment the movie’s “likes” property (in the array of objects where the json data was parsed) on every button click.

(20 points) Every time the “Like” button is clicked, the number of “likes” (the number shown next to the “Like” button in the template) should increase by one.

Bonus Points: (20 points) Add a Sort button that will sort the resulting list of movies according to their current like property status (e.g. on descending order of likes).
